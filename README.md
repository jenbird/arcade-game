## Project Background

This project was completed as part of the Udacity Google Scholarship (Phase 2, Project 4) and tested Javascript OOP skills. This code utilises classes and objects in order to create the enemy and player objects. Class prototype functions were used to render, update and handle inputs for the objects. Appropriate use of the keyword "this" was practiced.

The main file edited in making this app was the app.js file. The HTML canvas, game engine and resources file were provided as starter files.

## Instructions

Loading the game:
Download the folder with all files. Go to your preferred browser and open the index.html file. This game app is optimised for Google Chrome.

Playing the game:
Once the game is open, use your keyboard to move the player around. Avoid the bugs!
If you hit a bug, your player will be sent back to the beginning. Try to reach the water to win the game!

## Dependencies

The game uses an online Google font. The font is downloaded via an online library (via a link in the head of the HTML file so you will need to be online to see this properly.

## Resources

Code was pulled from a Udacity repository (and amended in line with the project [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric)). The starter project had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. Some modifications were made to the HTML and CSS files but the predominant assessment was of Javascript skills.

HTML changes included changing ID and classes of elements in order to manipulate the DOM better and provide CSS styling. Most CSS changes related to animation and the addition of media queries to provide a more responsive design for smaller viewports on a variety of devices. Other CSS changes were to ensure there were no bugs in the playing of the game.
